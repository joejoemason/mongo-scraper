### App design to scrape articles and save them in Mongo database

## App scrapes articles from [NYTimes Science](https://www.nytimes.com/section/science "NYTimes Science") and displays them using HandlebarsJS. We use MongoDB to save the information and to make them available to be used.

### Click on the scrape button to retrieve the articles. After that, save the ones of your interest. Click on the saved articles button to see them. If you don't want the article anymore, just click the unsave button. If you like the article and want to create a note to it just click on the note button. A modal will show so you can input your note.

#### Here is a demo of the app:
